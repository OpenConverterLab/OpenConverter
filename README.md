[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=OpenConverterLab_OpenConverter&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=OpenConverterLab_OpenConverter)

## üì¢ Project Introduction

OpenConverter is software built on the [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/), [**Qt**](https://www.qt.io/), and [**BMF**](https://babitmf.github.io). It provides simple and user-friendly tools to convert, edit, and process audio and video files.

The converter includes the following main features:

1. Supports changing video codecs for encoding (e.g., libx264, libx265).
2. Supports lossless multimedia conversion.
3. Displays information about video and audio streams in multimedia files.
4. Compresses images with format and quality control.
5. Extracts audio from video files.
6. Cuts video with built-in FFmpeg-based player and precise time selection.
7. Shows smooth progress tracking and accurate remaining time while converting files.
8. Allows runtime switching of transcoding cores (FFmpeg, FFTool, BMF).
9. Provides both GUI and Command Line Interface (CLI) for flexible usage.

This project is developed using the [Qt framework](./doc/Qt.md), the FFmpeg library, and the [BMF framework](https://github.com/BabitMF/bmf).

### 1. Support for Changing Audio and Video Codecs for Encoding (e.g., libx264, libx265, aac, ac3)

This converter allows users to easily change audio and video codecs. For example, you can choose to use the libx264 or libx265 encoder for higher compression rates and better video quality.

### 2. Support for Lossless Multimedia Conversion

The converter also supports lossless multimedia conversion. This means you can directly convert files from one format to another without re-encoding the original video and audio streams. This is very useful for quick file conversions.

### 3. Display Information About Video and Audio Streams

This converter can display detailed information about video and audio streams, including resolution, frame rate, bitrate, etc. This helps you understand the properties of multimedia files for making appropriate adjustments during conversion.

### 4. Image Compression

Compress images with customizable settings:
- Format conversion (JPEG, PNG, WebP, BMP)
- Resolution adjustment
- Quality control (1-31)

### 5. Audio Extraction

Extract audio from video files with codec selection:
- Multiple audio formats (MP3, AAC, AC3, FLAC, WAV)
- Bitrate control

### 6. Video Cutting

Cut video segments with precision:
- Built-in FFmpeg-based video player
- Real-time playback and seeking
- Accurate start/end time selection
- Supports all FFmpeg-compatible formats

### 7. Advanced Progress Tracking and Time Estimation

During file conversion, the player provides:
- Smooth progress updates with UI-friendly refresh rates
- Accurate remaining time estimation using duration smoothing
- Real-time progress percentage and duration tracking
- Detailed console output for monitoring conversion status

### 8. Runtime Switching of Transcoding Cores (FFmpeg, FFTool, BMF)

The software offers three different transcoding cores to choose from:
- FFmpeg API-based core for direct library integration
- FFTool core for command-line tool integration
- BMF framework-based core for advanced processing
You can also selectively compile these cores based on your needs.

### 9. Command Line Interface (CLI) Support

Usage in non-GUI mode:
```bash
./OpenConverter [options] input_file output_file

Options:
  -t, --transcoder TYPE    Set transcoder type (FFMPEG, BMF, FFTOOL)
  -v, --video-codec CODEC  Set video codec
  -q, --qscale QSCALE      Set qscale for video codec
  -a, --audio-codec CODEC  Set audio codec
  -b:v, --bitrate:video BITRATE    Set bitrate for video codec
  -b:a, --bitrate:audio BITRATE    Set bitrate for audio codec
  -pix_fmt PIX_FMT         Set pixel format for video
  -scale SCALE(w)x(h)      Set scale for video (width x height)
  -h, --help               Show this help message
```

Example:
```bash
# Convert video using FFmpeg core with H.264 video codec
./OpenConverter -t FFMPEG -v libx264 input.mp4 output.mp4

# Convert video using BMF core with H.265 video codec and AAC audio codec
./OpenConverter -t BMF -v libx265 -a aac input.mp4 output.mp4
```
